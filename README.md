# 🌈 GamePlatform 🌈

### 🚀 Overview
This project brings together three different games: **Hangman**, **Skyjo**, and **Cemantix**. Just fork the project, set up a virtual environment, install Django, and run `python manage.py runserver`. After setup, you’ll be able to access the main game interface and start playing.

### 🃏 Skyjo
A detailed digital version of the popular **Skyjo** card game. Playable with 2 to 4 players, it includes options for score tracking, points display, and full gameplay management from start to finish.

### 🔠 Hangman
The classic **Hangman** word-guessing game. Play against the computer and try to guess the word before your chances run out!
